# Asaph

## Getting Started
1. Download the project files
2. Open a command prompt window in the project folder
3. Run 'npm install' to install all the required dependencies
4. Run 'npm start' to open the server
5. Goto 'localhost' in your browser

Note that because the video streaming requires the use of an HTTPS server, a certificate is required. Because Asaph is still under development a self-signed certificate has been used which results in a security warning which can be safely ignored in the browser.
